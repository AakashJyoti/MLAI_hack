Clarifications to Queries on
Guidelines for Licensing of Payments Banks in the Private Sector
In providing the clarifications, an attempt has been made to assist potential applicants in
understanding the terms of the guidelines. The clarifications are specific to the queries
and must be read in the overall context of the guidelines.
1. Please provide a timeline for the shortlisted as well as final list of applicants
getting the Small Finance Bank/ Payments Bank licence.
A. The timelines will depend primarily on the number of applications received, and time
taken for completion of the approval process. No definite timeline can, therefore, be
provided at this stage.
2. If the payments bank appoints an entity as its business correspondent (BC),
would that entity be able to perform business facilitation (BF) activities such as
loan sourcing for some other bank in addition to performing payment related
activities for the payment bank?
A. Yes, subject to RBI guidelines for banks appointing BCs.
3. Would the payments bank be able to appoint its promoter group company
(parent or other subs) as its corporate BC?
A. Yes, on arm's length basis and subject to the RBI guidelines on BCs.
4. We wish to understand can the Payments Bank entity leverage the existing
infrastructure such as technology, distribution (including distribution
resources/outlets/premises) and business correspondent services of its promoter
group or parent company on an arm’s length basis, while ensuring that all
1financial related matters including treasury and risk/regulatory activities are
completely ring-fenced from the Promoter Group/Parent Company.
5. Guidelines provide that the other financial and non-financial services activities
of the Promoters, if any, should be kept distinctly ring fenced and not comingled
with the banking business. Please explain what kind of management oversight,
sharing of infrastructure, human capital etc. would be acceptable as being ring-
fenced?
6. Whether arm’s length basis of sharing infrastructure and distribution network
for acquiring and servicing the customers should qualify the condition that the
activities of the payments bank are ring fenced and not comingled with the other
activities of the promoter group?
7. The guidelines state that “the other financial and non-financial services
activities of the promoters, if any, should be kept distinctly ring-fenced and not
comingled with the banking and financial services business of the payments
bank”. We would appreciate that this aspect is explained in greater detail.
8. Kindly confirm that the “Payments Bank” is allowed to leverage on the
distribution network of the “promoter” and distribution network of its PPI
business which is managed through a separate wholly owned subsidiary.
9. Can the Payments Bank solution be co-located in the groups own telecom
infrastructure - including Data Center (DC) and Disaster Recovery Center (DR). If
any logical separation is needed, would just logical separation of servers hosted
suffice (like a separate cage) OR do we need complete separation including
separation of other infrastructure components like the pipes, networking and
security devices etc. Can the Payments Bank solution be hosted in a third-party
Data Center. In our Payments bank model, the DC will be 100% redundant. Will it
still be mandatory to have a full functioning DR on day one of operations?
2Request to share if any specific monitoring parameters (at infrastructure and
service level) are expected for compliance. Also, for DR request to share RBI side
expectation on RPO/RTO parameters for Payments Bank.
As an existing telecom operator, we currently have an extensive Customer
Relationship Management (CRM) system. Can we leverage this system for
Payments Bank? Can the Payments bank’s accounting, financial, payroll and
HRMS systems be part of the parent group/entity systems. Though the
data/systems are required to be separate for Payments Bank and Telco or other
services, can there be a common set of users at parent group level having access
to both systems, or controlling process of both the systems. Request to clarify
with respect to the following types of users:
a) Managed services personnel having access to the DC and devices
b) Information security officers, and process related staff
c) Helpdesk users
d) Business users
10. Clarification is sought on whether the payments bank entity can leverage the
existing infrastructure such as distribution, technology, and business
correspondent services of its promoter group or parent company at ‘arm’s
length’: ensuring that all financial related matters including treasury and
risk/regulatory activities are completely ring fenced from the promoter
group/parent company, including a general restriction on comingling of customer
deposits with promoter funds. Furthermore, with regards to leveraging the
distribution network, ensuring that there is a clear legal separation between their
current role as the promoter’s distributor from their role as payment bank outlets.
11. What exactly is expected to be ring fenced? For example, if a telecom
operator applies for payment bank license, will it have to ring fenced people,
processes, IT systems, infrastructure, logistics, outsourcing, HR, Finance
function and indirect support functions?
312. How the ring fencing is to be achieved?
A. (4 to12) Ring fencing does not restrict arrangements for sharing of infrastructure of
the parent promoter / promoter group entities, provided that there is an agreement /
contract, etc. if such arrangement is entered into on an arm's length basis suitable
firewalls are built in, customer confidentiality maintained and risk mitigation measures
are put in place for operational risk. The business plan can clearly bring out these
aspects. However, any the PPI entity cannot coexist with the payment bank in the same
group.
13. Does the ring fencing to be supported by any external certification or RBI will
carry out any inspection?
A. It will be an ongoing requirement.
14. The Annexure to the guidelines (para 3) prescribes the list of information/
documentation required for Promoter Group entities which include among other
things, the management and corporate structure, total assets of the entities,
credit facilities sought and bank account details. We wish to seek the following
clarification with respect to the information required in the Annexure to the
guidelines in order to comply with the stipulated requirements.
We being a well-diversified group and having operations in many foreign
countries which are being run through offshore subsidiaries set up through
different holding structures, it may be extremely cumbersome (and possibly not
relevant) to furnish the credit facilities/ bank account details, regulator, PAN,
TAN, CIN, pictorial organogram indicating the structure of such foreign entities.
Hence can we believe submitting the below information would suffice the
requirements of Annex I Para (3)?
a) The complete details as sought for all the resident Indian entities of the
Promoter and Promoter Group.
4b) The financial statements (audited/unaudited) of the foreign entities for the past
five years.
c) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Promoter as per
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
A. (a to c)The Annexure to the guidelines indicate that the names of the individuals and
entities, details of shareholding, management and corporate structure of all the entities,
a pictorial organogram indicating the structure, shareholding and total assets of the
entities should be submitted. The organogram should start with the main individual
promoters indicating their shareholding in the group entities and also cross holding
among the group entities. Organogram for each group entity is not required. The details
required as per the annexure to the guidelines are required to be submitted by the
applicants.
15. With reference to the Guidelines for Licensing of Payments Banks and Small
Finance Banks, we shall be obliged if you could kindly grant us extension of time

control over the retailer points, in the context of payment bank guidelines the

years?
b. Whether the shareholding in the Intermediate Holding Company can
change inter-se between Promoter group within the above-mentioned
thresholds?

69. Are all non-Indian citizens assumed to be excluded from a customer
relationship with a Payments Bank? Since cross-border remittance transactions
are allowed (as per Clause 4(viii)), would in-bound remittances into an account
maintained with Payments Bank regarded as a deposit? (See Clause 4(i))
70. The Guidelines state in regulation 4 (i) that “No NRI deposits should be

72. Will Payment Banks be allowed to connect to National Unified USSD Platform
(NUUP) of NPCI? (See Clause 4(vii))?
A. Yes.

actual commencement of operations?
21(ii) Whose shareholding is subject to the said lock-in: (a) the shareholding held by
the Promoter Company i.e. the company that has applied for the approval for
Payments Bank; (b) the foreign shareholder of the Payments Bank (who may also
be the shareholder of such Promoter Company); or (c) both.
A. (i) As per the guidelines, the promoters of the payments bank should hold at least 40
per cent of its paid-up equity capital for the first five years from the date of banking
licence.
(ii) The shareholding of the promoters will be subject to lock-in i.e., option (a) above.
75. Are there any lock-in or other restrictions on shareholding of Promoter
Company?
A. Any proposed material change in the shareholding pattern in the promoter entity at
the time of application and during the period between the application and in-principle
approval and even thereafter should be brought to the prior notice of Reserve Bank of
India.
76. The set of guidelines/restrictions that will apply for Payments Banks BC
points.
A. The guidelines applicable to scheduled commercial banks for engaging BCs will
apply to payments banks also.
77. Owing to the restriction on the limit the core business of payments bank that
is the payments and remittances may get affected. Acceptance of a large pool of
money for remittance to other accounts during the day with only the day end
balance being restricted to Rs. 100,000 gives some relief, yet it may affect the
efficiency in terms of having the funds transferred to another account to meet this
requirement.
22May we suggest that an enhanced limit be considered as an average Quarterly
Balance differently, for the Savings accounts and current account by Payments
Bank as this model is secure for the deposit holders as well as is in line with RBI
and Government's objective of financial inclusion.
A. The current limit of Rs. 1,00,000 per individual customer remains.
78. Some of the PPIs has been in operation for less than 5 years, and are
considering applying for Payments Bank license. We would request you to please
guide us on how to meet the requirement of submission of 5 years of financial
records of the applicant entity.
79. In case of an entity registered under PSS Act for prepaid instrument issuance (PPI),
which has been in business for less than 5 years, will RBI consider such entity for
conversion into the bank (given that PPI’s have been approved by RBI over last three
years)?
A.(78 to 79) As per the guidelines, RBI would assess the ‘fit and proper’ status of the
applicants and group entities on the basis of their past record of sound credentials and
integrity; financial soundness and successful track record of at least 5 years
professional experience or in running their businesses. For promoters of PPI issuers
having less than five years of track record, the track record prior to PPI business will be
seen.
80. Since foreign investment upto 49% is permitted in the Promoter Company,
can the same foreign shareholder also hold 74% directly in the Payments Bank?
Will the direct and indirect foreign shareholding be aggregated for computing the
overall cap of 74%?
A. The answer to both the parts of the question is “No”.
2381. This clause provides that “…shareholder’s voting rights in private sector
banks are capped at 10 per cent.” How should this phrase be interpreted? For
example, if the Payments Bank only has two shareholders, each having a 10%
voting rights, what happens to the remaining 80%? Would the cap on voting
rights be valid for meetings of board of directors or shareholders, or both?
82. We note from Clause 7 that since Payments Banks cannot undertake lending
activities, it is not compulsory for them to have a diversified ownership, unlike in
the case of universal commercial banks. Given the above, what is the rationale for
imposing the 10% cap on the voting rights of each shareholder?
A. (81 to 82) The cap on voting rights is as per the provisions of the BR Act, 1949 which
presently is 10 per cent. The cap on voting rights is for the shareholders.
83. Would the cap of 10% apply to each shareholder under whose name shares
are held, or each “shareholder group” comprising of affiliates and related
entities? If such cap will be applicable to each shareholder group, what will be the
basis of clubbing the entities together?
A. The cap on voting rights is per person as indicated in Section 12 (2) of BR Act 1949.
84. Can the shareholders of the Payments Bank by way of a shareholders/joint
venture agreement, restrict the voting rights to even less than 10% for a particular
shareholder who is holding more than 10% of the paid-up share capital)?
85. If the answer to the above query is no, can the voting rights be
proportionately reduced based on the shareholding of each shareholder? As an
example, if a shareholder holds 60% and his voting rights are capped at 10%,
then can the voting rights of the other shareholder holding 40% be capped at
6.67%?
24A. (84 to 85) Payments banks can issue differential voting rights, subject to minimum
equity capital being voting equity. As on date the voting rights are limited to 10 per cent
per shareholder (Section 12(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 ). The provision
relating to 26 per cent voting rights is an enabling provision for the future.
86. In paragraph I (3), information relating to all entities in the promoter group is
required to be provided. Is this requirement limited only to direct shareholders of
the Promoter Company or does this extend to indirect shareholders of the
Promoter Company and entities under common control of the ultimate
