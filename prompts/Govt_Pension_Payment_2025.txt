4. Should acknowledgement be given by pension paying banks while accepting Life Certificates from pensioners?
There have been complaints that life certificates submitted over the counter of pension paying branches are misplaced causing delay in payment of monthly pensions. In order to alleviate the hardships faced by pensioners, agency banks were instructed to mandatorily issue duly signed acknowledgements. They were also requested to consider entering the receipt of life certificates in their CBS and issue a system generated acknowledgement which would serve the twin purpose of acknowledgement as well as real time updation of records. Banks may provide digital acknowledgements in respect of digital life certificates submitted by the pensioners.
5. Is it possible to submit life certificates without visiting the branch?
Yes, pensioners can submit life certificates without visiting the branch using Jeevan Praman provided the Pension Sanctioning Authority is on boarded on the platform. Further, banks have also been advised to provide super senior citizens (pensioners over 70 years of age) and differently abled or infirm persons (having medically certified chronic illness or disability) including those who are visually impaired, the facility to submit life certificate at the premises/ residence of such customers.

Withdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners
(i) In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners in withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorise such pensioners as under:
(a) Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the bank.
(b) Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also not even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form due to certain physical defect / incapacity.
(ii) With a view to enabling such old/sick/incapacitated pensioners to operate their accounts, banks may follow the procedure as under:
(a) Wherever thumb or toe impression of the old/sick pensioner is obtained, it should be identified by two independent witnesses known to the bank, one of whom should be a responsible bank official.
(b) Where the pensioner cannot even put his/her thumb/ toe impression and also would not be able to be physically present in the bank, a mark can be obtained on the cheque/withdrawal form, which should be identified by two independent witnesses, one of whom should be a responsible bank official.
The responsible bank official has to be from the same bank, preferably from the same branch, where the pensioner is having his/her pension account.
Agency banks have been asked to display the instructions issued in this regard on their notice board at the branches so that sick and disabled pensioners can make full use of these facilities.

The pension paying agency banks have to revise the Dearness Relief based on the copies of government orders provided by government to them through post, fax, e-mails or by accessing the information from the website of the concerned governments, and authorize their pension paying branches to make payments to the pensioners immediately.
8. Whether a pensioner is entitled for any compensation from the agency banks for delayed credit of pension/ arrears of pension?
