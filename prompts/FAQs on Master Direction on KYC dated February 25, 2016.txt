Q 19. What is Video-based Customer Identification Process (V-CIP)?
Ans. V-CIP is an alternate method of customer identification with facial recognition and customer due diligence that allows REs to obtain and verify a customer’s identity information through a digital, secure, live, informed and consent-based and live audio-visual interaction between an authorised RE official and the customer to obtain identification information required for CDD purpose. V-CIP eliminates the need for physical visit to a branch of the RE but is treated on par with face-to-face CIP.

Ans. V-CIP may be used for carrying out the following processes:
to undertake CDD in case of onboarding a new individual customer, proprietor in case of proprietorship firm, authorised signatories and beneficial owners in case of Legal Entity customers;

for updation/ periodic updation of KYC records of eligible customers.
Q 22. Why does an RE periodically ask for KYC documents from the customer when the customer has already submitted the same during opening of account?
Ans. RE is required to update the customers’ KYC records as part of ongoing due diligence process to ensure that the information or data collected under CDD is kept up to date and relevant. The periodicity of such updation depends on the risk categorisation of the customer by the RE and such periodic updation of KYC records (at times referred to as re-KYC) shall be carried out at least once in every two years for high-risk, eight years for medium risk and ten years for low-risk customers. However, RE may adopt any additional and exceptional measures as per its internal KYC policy which inter alia may require physical presence of the customer, periodic updation of KYC only in the branch of the RE where account is maintained, a more frequent periodicity of KYC updation than the minimum specified periodicity, etc.
Q 23. What are the parameters used by the RE for risk categorisation of a customer?
Ans. The broad indicative parameters prescribed for customer’s risk categorisation are customer’s identity, social/ financial status, nature of business activity, information about the customer’s business and his/ her location, geographical risk covering customer as well as transactions, type of products/ services offered, delivery channel used for delivery of products/ services, types of transaction undertaken – cash, cheque/monetary instruments, wire transfers, forex transactions, etc. While considering customer’s identity, the ability to confirm identity documents through online or other services offered by issuing authorities may also be factored in.
