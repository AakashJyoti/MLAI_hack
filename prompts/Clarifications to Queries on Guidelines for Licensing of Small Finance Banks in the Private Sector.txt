Clarifications to Queries on
Guidelines for Licensing of Small Finance Banks in the Private Sector
In providing the clarifications, an attempt has been made to assist potential applicants in
understanding the terms of the guidelines. The clarifications are specific to the queries
and must be read in the overall context of the guidelines.
1. Will a group having two NBFC licences, one of which is a non–operative
holding company for the main non-banking financial business and the other
being the main financial business itself, surrender both its licences or only the
active non-banking financial business licence while converting into a bank?
A. The operating NBFC has to fold into the bank and the non-operative holding
company would be allowed to continue.
2. What criteria may be used for determining an enterprise as a large business
house? Whether a diversified financial services group will be considered as a
large business house for the purposes of these Guidelines?
3. Will an existing group with the main activity being the NBFC business (80%
profit share of whole group) and certain smaller businesses (20% of profits of the
whole group) be considered an industrial and business group?
4. Please clarify the meaning of ‘large industrial and business houses’.
5. It is stated that large business houses and the NBFCs formed by such
promoters are not eligible to apply for the license. Can you please clarify the
criteria for determining the size (like large business houses)?
6. What is the threshold condition for deciding large or not large industry or
business house?
17. What constitutes large industrial house / business houses, is there a threshold
prescribed for this on net worth, market cap etc.?
A.(2 to 7) For the purpose of these guidelines, a Group with assets of Rs 1000 crore
with the non-financial business of the group accounting for 40 per cent or more in terms
of total assets / in terms of total revenue (whichever is higher), will be treated as a large
industrial / business group.
8. Can a promoter (individual) of large Business / Industrial House act as
promoter himself to form a Small Bank?
A. No.
9. Whether NBFCs having substantial asset sizes will also fall in this negative list
even though not formed by large industrial/ business houses?
A. An NBFC, which is not part of a large business/industrial house is eligible.
10. We would also appreciate if you could clarify the exact meaning of the term
“owned and controlled by residents” as contemplated in the SFB Guidelines.
11. The guidelines require that Companies, owned and controlled by residents,
will be eligible. However the terms “owned” and “control” have not been defined.
Would the terms have the same meaning as defined in the FDI policy?
12. Kindly clarify the meaning/scope of ‘owned and controlled by residents’.
13. Please clarify the definition of “owned and controlled” and “resident”?
14. Whether such companies and societies are to be fully (100%) owned by
residents? What is the definition of control? Does this mean that the board needs
2to be fully residents? or the executive management needs to be fully residents?
Does society mean only charity registered ones or whether co-operatives come
under the definition?
15. Whether such NBFCs and MFIs etc. are to be fully (100%) owned by
residents? What is the definition of control? Does this mean that the board needs
to be fully residents? or the executive management needs to be fully residents?
16. Whether the “Owned” as referred in RBI guidelines shall mean to 26% equity
share holding or more than 50% of equity shareholding in the Company?
17. Whether companies incorporated in India fully or partly owned by non-
residents on non-repatriation basis will be eligible to apply?
18. Whether companies incorporated in India partly owned by non residents on
repatriation basis (within the FDI norms) will be eligible to apply?
A.(10 to 18) The definition is as per the Government’s FDI policy and the FEMA
regulations as amended from time-to-time. As per the current FDI policy and FEMA
regulations, a Company ‘Owned by residents’ shall be an Indian company if more than
50% of the equity interest in it is beneficially owned by resident Indian citizens and or
Indian companies, which are ultimately owned and controlled by resident Indian
citizens. A company shall be considered ‘Controlled' by resident Indian citizens and
Indian companies, if the resident Indian citizens and Indian companies, which are
owned and controlled by resident Indian citizens, have the power to appoint a majority
of its directors in that company.
19. Can 49% of the Indian owned and controlled promoter entity shareholding be
with one FDI PE fund and remaining with residential Indian investors?
A. As regards ownership and control, the definition is as per the Government’s FDI
policy and the FEMA regulations as amended from time to time. It appears from the
3query that the FDI PE fund has the control and therefore is not eligible to promote a
bank.
20. Whether the qualification of ownership and control by resident applies only to
Local Area Banks and not to NBFCs and MFIs?
A. The requirement of ownership and control by residents applies to all entities
promoting / converting into a small finance bank, including NBFCs and MFIs.
21. The guidelines mention that a promoter of NBFC seeking to convert into a
Small Finance Bank cannot own other NBFCs. How will “ownership” be defined
for this purpose? Will minority ownership with no influence on the management
of an NBFC be excluded from the definition of ownership? For example, if the
promoter entity has less than 25% stake in another NBFC with no representation
on the board or management, will such an investment be allowed?
22. We seek your guidance on roadmap for our associate concerns. Our NBFC
has 26% stake in an entity engaged in Insurance Broking Services. The insurance
broking entity has the rest of the shareholding of 74% by individual promoters.
The company is engaged in the business of offering Insurance Services as Direct
Insurance Broker and is governed by IRDA and provides insurance cover on the
assets being financed by the NBFC and for other customers.
23. Where a person / entity is acting as a promoter, for an NBFC/MFI/LAB as well
as another entity which would be set-up as a SFB or converted into SFB, would it
be correct to say that the NBFC/MFI/LAB and the SFB could co-exist within the
same Promoter/ Promoter group?
24. Based on a combined reading of these guidelines under Para 10 and Para 4,
where other entities of the promoter group which are currently engaged in non-
risk sharing simple financial services activities (not requiring any commitment of
own funds) such as distribution of mutual fund units, insurance products, etc.,
4would it be correct to say that the promoter group need not mandatorily fold
these activities (being undertaken by other entities) into the SFB?
25. Our NBFC has 38% stake in an entity engaged in micro finance. Can we
continue the business outside the bank?
26. Where the promoter of a Small Finance Bank also currently owns an NBFC,
would RBI insist on the promoter bringing all NBFC activities, to the extent can be
undertaken by SFB, under the Small Finance Bank?
27. Can the NBFC having an NBFC MFI subsidiary make an application for a small
bank through that subsidiary to convert MFI as a SMFB and whether the parent
company can continue its NBFC business?
28. In the above scenario is it necessary for the NBFC to have a Non –operating
holding company which will hold the stake in NBFC as well as the SMFB?
A. (21 to 28) The NBFC will be considered as belonging to the same promoter group if
it falls within the definition of promoter group as indicated in the guidelines and as
defined in the SEBI (Issue of Capital & Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009.
Further, any NBFC carrying lending activity cannot co-exist with SFB.
The guidelines indicate that on conversion into a small finance bank, the NBFC / MFI
will cease to exist and all its business which a bank can undertake should fold into the
bank and the activities which a bank cannot undertake be divested / disposed of. The
other financial and non-financial services activities of the promoters should be kept
distinctly ring-fenced and not comingled with the bank.
The guidelines indicate that if a promoter setting up a small finance bank desires to set
up a Payments Bank, it should set up both types of banks under a Non-Operative
Financial Holding Company (NOFHC) structure. Otherwise, there is no requirement for
the small finance banks to have holding company structure.
529. The guidelines prescribe that joint-ventures by different Promoter Groups
would not be allowed. Would this restrict a Promoter to get new financial
investors before making the application? If yes, are there any restrictions on such
investments?
30. (i) What does joint ventures by different promoters group mean?
(ii) If the eligible promoter entity has a strategic investor or is formed by 2-3
different individuals/entities who are unrelated and who act as its shareholders,
whether the said entity would be considered as joint venture by different
promoters group?
(iii) Can there be multiple promoters, i.e. non-related individuals/corporate
entities who would become shareholders of a company which will act as a
promoter entity for setting up a Bank. Will the same be permissible?
(iv) Whether the individuals/professionals can set up an entity together with an
existing NBFC/MFI/LAB to establish SFB?
A.(29 to 30) The guidelines indicate that joint ventures by different promoter groups for
the purpose of setting up small finance banks would not be permitted. However, the
promoter could get non-promoter investors in the bank subject to ceiling on such
investments [para 13 (ii) of the guidelines] and subject to the respective sectoral
regulators’ guidelines requirement.
If the small finance bank is promoted by resident individuals / professionals, they should
have 10 years of experience in banking and finance. If the small finance bank is
promoted by Companies / Societies or existing Non-Banking Finance Companies
(NBFCs), Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs), and LABs desire to convert into a small
finance bank, they should have a successful track record of running their businesses for
at least a period of five years.
631. Whether registered Indian charitable trust/ Private or Public trusts are allowed
to promote a SFB?
32. In paragraph 3 of the Guidelines for setting up of Small Finance Bank the
eligible promoters include resident individuals/ professionals, Companies and
Societies owned and controlled by residents. Will Trusts be considered as
eligible promoters? In particular, are NGO-MFIs run by Trusts considered as
eligible promoters or eligible to convert?
33. In case of a Bank where shares (say 90% of paid up capital) are held by
multiple trusts (say 9) having a common trustee, how would the restriction of 10%
voting rights apply:
a. b. Will the trustee have right to vote for 9 shareholders = 90% (i.e.
individually); or
The trustee can vote only once and his votes are restricted to 10%?
A. (31 to 33) The guidelines do not envisage Registered Indian charitable trusts /
Private or Public trusts to promote an SFB.
34. Whether the applicants who had applied for a universal banking licence in the
last round are eligible to apply for a SFB?
A. There is no restriction on any entity applying for small finance bank licence subject to
the eligibility criteria mentioned in the guidelines, except large industrial / business
houses.
35. While a company registered under the Companies Act, 2013 is eligible to
apply for registration as an SFB, it may be clarified that the existing Non-Banking
Financial Company (NBFC)/ Micro-Finance Institution (MFI)/ Local Area Bank
(LAB) registered earlier under the Companies Act, 1956 would also be eligible for
conversion to an SFB under Para 10 of the Guidelines.
7A. Yes.
36. Where an entity (i.e non-individual) is going to be a promoter for the applicant,
whether the experience of the applicant and promoter / promoter group
(individually) in banking and finance would be relevant? If yes, please clarify the
number of years of experience the applicant would be expected to have.
A. If the small finance bank is promoted by resident individuals / professionals, they
should have 10 years of experience in banking and finance. If the small finance bank is
promoted by Companies / Societies or existing Non-Banking Finance Companies
(NBFCs), Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs), and LABs desire to convert into a small
finance bank, they should have a successful track record of running their businesses for
at least a period of five years.
37. In case of an existing NBFC/ MFI/ LAB which proposes to convert into an SFB
having individuals and entities as its shareholders, whether the individuals and
the entity shareholders, together, can act as a promoter for the proposed SFB? If
yes, whether the said individuals / entities would be falling under the same
promoter group?
A. The definition of promoter / promoter group would be as defined in
the SEBI (Issue of Capital & Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009.
38. Where an existing NBFC/ MFI/ LAB has a majority shareholding from a
multistate co-operative (which was earlier a federation) having a vintage of less
than 5 years, whether the track record while the entity was a federation could be
taken into account for determining the track record?
8A. No. If existing NBFCs / MFIs / LABs desire to convert into a small finance bank, they
should have a successful track record of running their businesses for at least a period of
five years.
39. Where an NBFC/ MFI/ LAB is acquired by the present promoter/ promoter
group within last 5 years, whether such NBFC/ MFI/ LAB would be eligible to
convert itself into SFB and whether the experience of the applicant/ promoter/
promoter group prior to the acquisition (by the promoter/ promoter group) would
be relevant?
A. Yes. If existing NBFCs / MFIs / LABs desire to convert into a small finance bank, they
should have a successful track record of running their businesses for at least a period of
five years. However, if there is an acquisition of the NBFC / MFI / LAB by the present
promoter / promoter group, their track record for five years will be examined.
40. Whether co-operative bank is eligible as a promoter to set up small finance

41. Our private limited company, has been working as Technology Service
Provider (TSP) and National Business Correspondent (National BC) for a public
sector bank (PSB) since January 2009 and November 2010. Since its
incorporation, the company has been working on technology-led branchless
banking models and processes. In addition to the PSB, the company also
operates as a TSP to two private sector banks and a National BC to one of the
banks. Whether the company is eligible to apply for “Small Finance Bank” licence
as the Company as well as each of the two promoters have 7 years of experience
in banking and finance but not 10 years of experience?
9A. Yes, if the small finance bank is promoted by Companies / Societies or existing Non-
Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs), Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs), and LABs,
they should have a successful track record of running their businesses for at least a
period of five years.
42. A private limited company currently has only 2 promoters who would hold
40% of the paid up equity capital. However, the two promoters will be entitled to
exercise only 10% voting rights each. Accordingly, for the aforesaid purposes,
the private limited company will have to issue equity shares with differential
voting rights to the two promoters, which would require compliance with
conditions prescribed under Section 43(a)(ii) of the Companies Act, 2013 read
with Rule 4 of the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014. As per
the said Rules, the shares with differential rights shall not exceed twenty-six per
cent of the total post-issue paid up equity share capital of a company including
equity shares with differential rights issued at any point of time. Please clarify as
to how the private limited company will be required to structure its shareholding
pattern and the voting rights to be exercised by the promoters keeping in view
the requirements of the Rules as well as the small finance bank Guidelines.
43. Whether the promoter’s holding of 40% in the bank is entitled to only 10%
voting rights?
A.(42 to 43) For the purpose of voting rights in respect of shares held in private sector
banks, please be guided by the provisions of Section 12 (2) of the Banking Regulation
Act, 1949. As regards shareholding pattern of the company, it is not under the purview
of RBI.
44. Please clarify whether, an autonomous board set up under enactment of a
State legislature, where all the members are residents, will be considered under
the category Companies and Societies?
A. As per the current guidelines, it is not envisaged
1045. Is it necessary to have banking experience for such companies/societies? If
yes, will it be enough if one person with more than 10 year banking and finance
experience is a member/ employee of the Board?
46. If 7 or more resident individuals join together as promoters, is it enough that
there is one person with more than 10 year experience in banking and finance? If,
yes, can the Boards, referred above nominate their members as promoters?
A.(45 to 46) The question does not arise in view of the answer to Q 44 above.
47. There is “Successful track record of running the business” appearing in
clause 3. Does it refer to commercial business with profit motive or business of
the organisation as per the objectives of its constitution?
A. It would mean objectives of the organisation. For a commercial business, it would
mean a profitable / successful track record
48. Will an application from eligible promoters be considered on the basis of
merit of the application or the primary focus will be on the North East and East
Central region?
A. The applications will be considered based on the various criteria mentioned in the
guidelines. However, preference will be given to those applicants who in the initial
phase set up the bank in a cluster of under-banked States / districts, such as in the
North-East, East and Central regions of the country.
49. Can a state government hold shares in the SFB as a non-promoter, subject to
the cap specified in the guidelines?
A. A state government can hold shares in the SFB as a non-promoter. However, as
indicated in the guidelines, as per Section 12B of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, any
acquisition of 5 per cent or more of paid-up share capital in a private sector bank will
require prior approval of RBI.
1150. If under the directions of the Government of Kerala, 4 Labour Welfare Boards
in the state (which are autonomous bodies set up by the Act of the State) come
together as promoters;
a. b. Will it be construed as Joint Venture? [No Joint venture company will
be formed by them. They will come as promoters of the bank.]
Will it qualify as private sector? [These boards are autonomous
bodies, funded and managed by its beneficiaries. No government funding
is there. Only one representative of government is there in their governing
board and their functions are by and large independent].
A. No, the guidelines do not provide for the cited entities to promote an SFB.
51. What is the definition of word Promoter?
A. The definition of promoter / promoter group would be as defined in
the SEBI (Issue of Capital & Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009.
52. In case of an NBFC-MFI owned and controlled by resident Indians applying for
SFB licence, does RBI permit any resident Indian investors be replaced with
some other resident Indian investor(s)?
53. Is shareholding change allowed within the ‘Indian owned and controlled
promoting entity’ of the small bank? Specifically – can Resident Indian investors
be replaced with some other resident Indian investors?
54. If a promoter group is a corporate entity, will that be allowed to reconstitute
the portfolio by replacing foreign holding with Indian one or allowing foreign
holding to change hands, during the lock in period?
A.(52 to 54) Any proposed material change in the shareholding pattern in the promoter
entity at the time of application and during the period between the application and in-
12principle approval and even thereafter should be brought to the prior notice of Reserve
Bank of India.
As regards shareholding in the bank, a person or entity belonging to the Promoter
Group cannot be replaced during the lock-in-period.
55. Can a single Non Promoter FDI PE fund or single Non Promoter Resident
Investor which already has greater than 10% shareholding in the proposed SFB,
continue to have the same economic interest by having it's voting restricted to
10% by conversion of some of the existing equity shares to non voting equity
shares or through a clauses in the Articles of Association.
56. Can single Non Promoter FDI PE fund or Single Non Promoter Resident
investor have greater than 10% shareholding in the proposed Promoting Entity
NoHC which owns 100% of the SFB (that is indirectly interest >10%), but have its
voting rights restricted to 10% in the Promoting NoHC by conversion of some of
the equity shares to non‐ voting equity shares or through clauses in the Articles of
Association.
A.(55 to 56) No.
57. Further since PE funds represent multiple global investors, use SPVs to make
investments for these investors, investments by PE funds beyond 10% in the
Promoting NoHC would actually mean lesser than 10% by each of final investors.
In assessing the applications will the Corporate veil of the Promoting NoHC and/
or SPVs that invest in the Promoting NoHC be lifted to measure the real test of
<10% ownership. For example a PE Fund having 10 equal Global investors has
49% of the Promoting NOHC of the SFB which owns 100% of the SFB. Now in
economic terms while 100% of SFB is with the Promoting entity, further 49% is
with the PE SPA but the real global investors have only 4.9% each. Will this be the
basis of determining final economic interest?
1358. Where the Asset Management Company of a PE fund is the same for 2 sets of
PE funding, wherein ultimate investors are different would this be aggregated for
the single shareholder cap of 10% or be treated as separate. For example a PE
Fund in its Fund IV has 5 investors (a,b,c...e) and invests 10% in a SFB or its
NoHC. Then can the same PE Fund having the same AMC in its Fund V having 5
different investors (1,2,3...5) invest another 10% in the SFB or its NoHC?
A.(57 to 58) If the promoters desire to set up the Small Finance Bank under an
NOFHC, the NOFHC would be required to be wholly owned by the promoter group and
the lock-in period for the shareholding and the dilution schedule would be applied to the
NOFHC shareholding in the bank. In case of the bank, the PE Fund is reckoned as a
single investor. The shareholding cap of 10 per cent of the paid-up equity capital of the
bank will be applied at the PE Fund and AMC level, but not additive.
59. Point No. (II) of Key features of Small Finance Bank Guideline states as
“Resident individuals/professional with 10 years of experience in banking and
finance will be eligible to set up small finance banks.” For an example: If the
application is made jointly by four individuals/professionals like A,B, C and D.
Out of four applicants, two (B & C) are Non-resident in India and two others are
(A&D) are resident in India. With this example, we have the following question,
which requires your answer.
(a) If the applicant “B” and “C” files an affidavit along with the application and
declare that they are ready to convert their status as resident individual, provided
their application will be accepted and they will get an in-principle approval. In this
scenario, will they (B & C) be treated as an eligible promoters and RBI would have
no objection in granting the In-principle approval.
(b) Kindly confirm that the approval shall be granted in the joint name.
(c) Kindly confirm that at the time of application, the individual promoters need
not incorporate a company, as they are filing the application as a group of
promoters.
14A. (a & c) Yes. At the time of making applications, the Promoters/Promoter Group will
have to furnish a plan and methodologies they would adopt to comply with all the
requirements of the guidelines. After the ‘in-principle approval’ is accorded by RBI for
setting up of a bank, the Promoters/Promoter Group will have to comply with all the
requirements within 18 months from the date of in-principle approval or as on the date
of commencement of operations whichever is earlier.
(b) Yes, if the applicants / application are found suitable, the ‘in-principle approval’ will
be granted in the names of the promoters as declared in the application.
60. What are the special approvals required prior to submitting the application? –
is it from RBI/ROC or any government authorities? Whether the approvals are to
be obtained before making the application or post receipt of in-principle approval
for bank set up?
A. The approvals are to be submitted before licence is granted
61. Whereas Clause 3 of the Guidelines pertaining to eligible promoters
prescribes the persons who are eligible to promote Small Finance Banks. It also
states that joint venture by different promoter group is not permitted. Whether the
Special Purpose Vehicle incorporated by two entities (1- MFI & other Co-operative
Bank) for incorporating small banks, belonging to same promoter group is
eligible.
A. This will be treated as a Joint Venture and hence not permitted.
62. Is there any specific RBI Guidelines or circular to determine fit and proper
criteria for Promoter and Promoter Group w.r.t opening of SFB or does the RBI
examine the same on case to case basis?
A. As stated in para 3 of the guidelines, RBI would assess the ‘fit and proper’ status of
the applicants on the basis of their past record of sound credentials and integrity;
financial soundness and successful track record of professional experience or of
15running their businesses, etc. for at least a period of five years. RBI may, inter alia, seek
feedback on applicant Groups on these or any other relevant aspects from other
regulators, and enforcement and investigative agencies like Income Tax, CBI,
Enforcement Directorate, etc. as deemed appropriate.
63. The ideal number of branches a SFB shall have to be eligible for the license.
A. There is no such stipulation.
64. Can an individual/professional who is a resident in India for FEMA purposes
with requisite experience (over 10 years) in banking and finance will be eligible to
promote a ‘small finance bank’, if he is not an Indian citizen but is an OCI card
holder?
65. Erstwhile Indian residents’ [as defined in Department of Industrial Policy and
Promotion (DIPP)] passport holders, who currently hold foreign passport, but are
resident in India in terms of FEMA as well as Income Tax Act, would be
considered eligible promoters of Small Finance Bank? Can such resident
individual directly and /or indirectly hold more than 24% equity of the Small
Finance Bank?
A. For the purpose of these guidelines, the eligible individual promoter will have to be an
Indian citizen resident in India. As per para 13 (ii) of the guidelines, individuals
(including relatives) and entities other than the promoters will not be permitted to have
shareholding in excess of 10 per cent of the paid-up equity capital of the bank
66. Whether an Individual currently an NRI can apply subject to he/she deciding
to return for good for setting up of the Bank?
A. Yes.
1667. Whether the word “entities (other than promoter entities)” above in case of
existing NBFCs converting into small finance bank includes the foreign private
equity investors also, Since at present, one of our investor is a foreign
shareholder which holds 25% stake in the company.
A. Yes. Such an entity will be deemed to be ‘other than a promoter entity’. Such an
entity cannot have more than 10 per cent of the paid-up capital of the bank.
68. Whether SFCs would be eligible for promoting a SFB?
A. No, SFCs are not eligible to promote small finance banks.
69. A subsidiary of a Development finance institution is registered as non deposit
taking NBFC (Rs. 1000 crore company). Will the subsidiary be eligible to apply for
Small Finance Bank?
A. No.
70. Can an NBFC divest the activities which the banks are not allowed to another
NBFC of the group?
71. Whether the activities that cannot be undertaken as Bank but presently
carried out by NBFC / MFI can be divested to promoter of bank or other
promoters’ group entity as following sub-para of Para II.4 permits the other
financial and non-financial services activities of the promoters, if any, to be kept
distinctly ring-fenced and not comingled with the banking business?
A.(70 & 71) Lending activities must be conducted from inside the bank. Lending
activities that are not permitted to a bank, but are not prohibited to NBFCs, such as
promoter financing, loans for purchase of land, etc. would have to be wound up within a
period of 18 months from the date of in-principle approval or as on the date of
commencement of banking business, whichever is earlier. The other financial and non-
17financial services activities of the promoters should be kept distinctly ring-fenced and
not comingled with the bank.
72 Use of the word ‘small finance bank’ in the name of the bank: We were
given to understand in the draft guideline stage, that the bank would be merely
called a bank and not a small finance bank. In terms of raising deposits, these
new banks would have the major challenge of brand awareness and brand equity
compared to the existing banks and hence would take a long time to build up a
good level of retail deposits. On top of this, if they are required to say ‘small
finance bank’ in their name, the image created amongst depositors is that these
are ‘small’ banks and hence by corollary, not as safe as the ‘larger’ banks. This
would further hinder the efforts of these banks in mobilising deposits. Hence it is
requested that the name not be required to contain ‘small finance bank’.
A. No, the bank would be required to use “Small Finance Bank” in its name.
73. Currently banks are allowed to own housing finance companies (HFCs)
regulated by the National Housing Bank. Will Small Finance Banks be allowed to
own Housing Finance Companies?
If so, can the said Small Finance Bank through its subsidiaries take up Share
Broking or any intermediary activity requiring SEBI Approval?
A. No, SFBs are not allowed to set up any subsidiaries.
74. Our area of operation is Kerala state. Since this is not an under banked state,
can we apply? This is because the tone of the Guidelines is that initial licence will
be only for under-banked states.
75. Would it be correct to read the provision to mean that requirement of at least
25 per cent of branches in unbanked rural areas is only relevant in the context of
expansion plans (i.e. new branches which are proposed to be set-up over a
period of 5 years by the SFB) and an existing NBFC/ MFI/ LAB already having a
18wide network of branches which proposes to convert itself into SFB (pursuant to
which all the branches of the existing entity shall be converted into bank
branches), need not have 25 per cent of its existing branches in unbanked rural
areas?
76. In clause 4 (para 2), it is stated that “The annual branch expansion plans
should be in compliance with the requirement of opening at least 25 per cent of
its branches in unbanked rural centres..”. Will this condition of 25% rural bank
applicable at the time of formation itself or it applies only to further branch
expansions?
A. (74 to 76) The guidelines do not bar such applicants. However, the business plan
should include proposal for opening branches in unbanked rural centres as stipulated in
the guidelines. The stipulation is for total branch network.
77. What is the standard definition of a branch as per the RBI guidelines? Would
Satellite Offices, Mobile branches and Ultra Small formats be considered as
branches under the requirement to have 25% of new branches in unbanked rural
areas?
A. The definition of branch will be as per the provisions of Section 5(cc) of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949. Presently, other forms of presence such as satellite offices and
mobile branches are not considered as full-fledged branches under the requirement to
have 25 per cent branches in the unbanked rural centres. However, if the ultra-small
formats are full-fledged branches, they would qualify under the requirement to have 25
per cent branches in the unbanked rural centres.
78. An existing NBFC/MFI may have a large number of branches in rural and
unbanked areas. Will there be any ceiling on the number of such branches that
would be converted into bank branches?
19A. Please refer to para 10 of the guidelines.
79. Guidelines provide that the other financial and non-financial services
activities of the Promoters, if any, should be kept distinctly ring fenced and not
comingled with the banking business. Please explain what kind of management
oversight, sharing of infrastructure, human capital etc., would be acceptable as
being ring-fenced.
80. Where the promoters have separate board of directors, employees and an
arm’s length basis sharing of infrastructure/ technology, would other financial
and non-financial services activities of the promoters be regarded as distinctly
ring-fenced and not comingled with the banking business? If not, kindly explain
the circumstances under which the activities would be regarded as distinctly
ring-fenced.
81. What is the precise purport / meaning of the word “ring--‐ fencing’? Does it
mean even arm’s length business transaction/association with related entities of
promoter are not allowed?
82. Under the scope of activities i.e. Clause 4 of the Guidelines, it is stated that
the other financial or non-financial services activities of the promoters, if any
should be kept distinctly ring fenced and not comingled with banking business.
Can it be inferred that Promoters previously carrying on other financial services
or non-financial services should desist from carrying on such activities?
83. Will RBI consider separate Board and separate Management with no common
Board member or Management functionary as adequate ring fencing of the Small
Finance Bank from other financial sector businesses of the promoter?
A.(79 to 83) Ring fencing does not restrict arrangements for sharing of infrastructure of
the parent promoter / promoter group entities, provided that there is an agreement /
contract, etc.; if such arrangement is entered into on an arm's length basis, suitable
20firewalls are built in, customer confidentiality maintained and risk mitigation measures
are put in place. The business plan can clearly bring out these aspects.
84. Our private sector company is currently BC of two banks and has also
received in-principle approval for PPI.
a) If the entity applying for the license is an existing BC of the Bank then whether
the entity is required to discontinue its BC operations to be eligible to apply for a
licence of small finance bank?
b) If the entity is a PPI licence holder whether, the same will have to be
surrendered to be eligible to apply for a licence of small finance bank?
A. a) The guidelines stipulate that the small finance bank cannot be a Business
Correspondent (BC). However, it can have its own BC network or the BC business can
be transferred to a Group entity. .
b) If the entity is a PPI licence holder, this business should be folded into the bank.
85. Where an existing MFI (who proposes to convert itself into SFB) has a
separately run BC business, does it need to divest its BC business? Where MFI is
required to divest its BC business, could it divest the same within a period of
eighteen months once in-principle approval is obtained? Please confirm.
A. If the MFI desires to retain BC business, the same can be transferred to a
Group entity.
86.Whether the Promoter entity can continue to carry its other business (other
than which is to be carried out by bank for e.g. real estate, IT solutions, services,
manufacturing etc.) in the promoter entity itself or does the said business has to
be transferred to other entity by the promoter entity?
A. Promoter entity can continue to carry its other business (other than which is to be
carried out by bank for e.g. IT solutions, services etc.) in the promoter group. The other
21financial and non-financial services activities of the promoters should be kept distinctly
ring-fenced and not comingled with banking business.
87. Net worth – Can an existing NBFC with less than Rs.100 crore net worth at the
time of application and midway through a fund raising process (which will take
the net worth well above Rs.100 crore) apply for Small Finance Bank?
88. At the time of applying for small bank is Rs.100 crore required or RBI will
provide some time? What is the minimum capital requirement at the time of
application?
A.(87 & 88) At the time of making applications, the Promoters/Promoter Group will
have to furnish a plan and methodologies they would adopt to comply with all the
requirements of the guidelines within 18 months from the date of in-principle approval or
as on the date of commencement of operations whichever is earlier.
89. Whether the entity shall have minimum paid up capital of Rs. 100 crore as
well as Net worth of Rs. 100 crore?
A. The minimum paid-up capital of Rs.100 crore is for newly set up bank and net worth
of Rs.100 crore is for an NBFC/MFI/LAB converting into a bank.
90. If the promoter’s contribution in an existing NBFC is Rs. 5 crore in equity
capital which is equal to 30% of total paid up capital (Rs. 16.67 crore). If the net-
worth is Rs. 200 crore, will this meet the eligibility requirement of promoter
holding minimum 26% diluted capital of company and net-worth of Rs. 100 crore.
91. If Promoter holding is already less than 26% in NBFC/MFIs will the Promoters
have to comply with minimum initial contribution of 40% / 26% for paid-up equity
capital or 26% / 40% of net-worth if the net-worth is more than Rs. 100 crore.
2292. Whether an applicant, where the existing promoters hold less than 26%, be
eligible for making application for setting up of a new SFB or its conversion in a
SFB? Can the applicant will be given 18 months’ time to operationalize (under
Para II. clause 16(iv) of the guidelines) i.e. commit that the identified promoter will
have 26% before the bank becomes operational i.e. final approval from RBI.
93. For an existing entity, the promoters’ shareholding could be diluted below 40
per cent but above 26 per cent for ‘regulatory requirements or otherwise’. Would
it be correct to read this provision to mean that in case of conversion to an SFB,
the minimum promoters’ contribution is 26% and not 40%.
94. If a promoter of a NBFC‐ MFI intending to convert into SFB has diluted paid-up
capital below 26% and has a diversified ownership structure, then how does the
minimum promoter’s holding rule apply?
A. (90 to 94) If the promoter had reduced the contribution in the NBFC/MFI/LAB owing
to regulatory requirement, then the required holding in the bank will be 26%. If
otherwise, the promoter's minimum initial contribution to bank shall at least be 40 per
cent of the paid-up capital of the small finance bank.
95. Applicability of SEBI guidelines for the NBFCs already having net worth in
excess of Rs.500 crore: For those NBFCs that have net worth in excess of Rs 500
crore, post IPO, will the market regulator, SEBI’s guidelines, govern requirement
on promoter holdings?
A. Yes, if the SFB is listed, RBI guidelines with regard to minimum promoter holding and
SEBI guidelines will apply.
96. Point No. (iv) of Key features of Small Finance Bank Guideline states as “ the
minimum paid up equity capital for small finance bank shall be Rs.100 crore.
Point No. (v) of Key features of Small Finance Bank Guideline states as “The
promoters minimum initial contribution to the paid up equity capital of such small
23finance bank shall at least be 40 per cent and gradually brought down to 26 per
cent within 12 years from the date of commencement of the business of the
bank”.
For an example: The promoters A, B, C and D are ready to bring the required
capital at their own. However, they have the following constraints in arrangement
of share capital:
(a) Promoters have parked their funds in movable and immovable properties;
(b) In the immovable properties their spouse are co-owner’s; and
(c) Their spouses are ready to give their consent to sell the immovable property
to arrange the required share capital.
Considering the above proposition and its constraints, we would like to seek your
confirmation/clarification on the following questions:
(a) Will the RBI consider both the movable and immovable property as part of
Net Worth of Individual promoters?
(b) Is it necessary to give the name of shareholders and their creditworthiness
apart from promoters to ensure the arrangement of share capital?
(c) In case at the time of application, the promoters undertake that they are in a
position to arrange the requirement of minimum Paid up share capital of Rs. 100
crore at their own. However, after receipt of In-principle approval they find more
investors who are willing to invest in the share capital, can the promoters
accommodate the investors also, because in that case the total share capital in
the SFB will be in excess of Rs.100 crore?
A. (a) The minimum paid-up capital of Rs.100 crore should be readily available at the
time of obtaining banking licence.
(b) Yes. As indicated in the Annex to the guidelines, the applicants should furnish
detailed information about the persons/entities, who would subscribe to 5 per cent or
more of the paid-up equity capital (shareholding pattern) of the proposed bank,
including foreign equity participation in the proposed bank and the sources of capital of
the proposed investors.
24(c) Any material change from the proposal made in the application should be brought to
the notice of Reserve Bank of India during the period between the application and in-
principle approval and even thereafter. Further, as indicated in the guidelines, as per
Section 12B of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, any acquisition of 5 per cent or more
of the paid-up share capital in a private sector bank will require prior approval of RBI.
97. Will the SFB be allowed to raise 60% (after the promoters equity) by way of an
IPO?
A. After setting up of the bank with the required minimum paid-up capital of Rs.100
crore, if the bank proposes to go for an IPO, prior approval of RBI is necessary.(DBOD
circular dated April 20, 2010).
98. It appears that Para II. clause 6 of the SFB Guidelines requires that promoter
should maintain minimum initial contribution of prescribed percentage in case
promoter intends to set-up SFB. Please clarify as to whether existing Non-
Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs), Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) and LABs
which are planning to opt for conversion are also required to have minimum
initial contribution in accordance with clause 6 of the guidelines.
A. Please refer to para 10 of the guidelines.
99. Whether the lock-in of shareholding requirement would apply at the
Intermediate Holding Company level or at the Promoter/Investor level of the said
intermediate holding company. In other words, can the shareholders of the
intermediate holding company dilute his / its stake in the said company within 5
years / 10 years / 12 years thresholds.
A. The guidelines do not require setting up of a holding company to set up the SFB. If
there is an intermediate company, it should be an NOFHC and conform to all
25requirements relating to NOFHC stipulated in our guidelines on licensing of new banks
in the private sector dated February 22, 2013.
100. Where part of the Holding in the Intermediate holding company is held by a
Financial Investor / Private Equity Group, (as a Non-Promoter), whether there
would be any lock in requirements for such investors of the intermediate holding
company?
A. As the intermediate company has to be an NOFHC, it cannot have non-promoter
holding.
101. Can a Promoter exit completely after lock in period of five years?
A. Whether a promoter ceases to be a promoter or could exit from the bank would
depend on the RBI's regulatory and supervisory comfort / discomfort and SEBI
regulations in this regard at that time.
102. If an existing entity who proposes to convert itself into an SFB, has already
issued shares under Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOP) to an individual
promoter for the proposed SFB, whether the shares held by an ESOP trust for the
said individual promoter be considered as promoter’s contribution for the
purpose of Para 6 of the Guidelines?
A. Until the ESOPs are exercised, the question does not arise.
103. Between the time period that exists after the submission of SFB application
and In‐ principle approval – whether the promoter is required to maintain 26% of
Shareholding even if fresh equity is infused?
A. Yes, incidentally any material change from the proposal made in the application
should be brought to the notice of Reserve Bank of India during the period between the
application and in-principle approval and even thereafter.
26104. Whether promoter’s holding of 40% paid‐ up equity capital would include only
voting capital for the purposes of the initial capital requirement?
A. The initial minimum paid-up capital of Rs.100 crore would be voting equity.
105. SFB Guidelines, under Para II. Clause 7, prescribes the extent of foreign
shareholding permissible in small finance bank. Does it mean that such foreign
shareholding needs to be maintained only after setting-up or conversion of/ into
small finance bank? Is an NBFC, which is complying with the restriction on
permissible foreign shareholding as per SFB Guidelines and other requirement of
SFB Guidelines, eligible to either promote or convert itself into small finance
bank?
A. At the time of making applications, the Promoters/Promoter Group will have to furnish
a plan and methodologies they would adopt to comply with all the requirements of the
guidelines. After the ‘in-principle approval’ is accorded by RBI for setting up of a bank,
the Promoters/Promoter Group will have to comply with all the requirements within 18
months from the date of in-principle approval or as on the date of commencement of
operations whichever is earlier. In this context, it may be clarified that even if the NBFC
is compliant with foreign shareholding norms as applicable to banks, any entity /
individual shareholding of 5% or more would require prior approval of RBI.
106. While Para 3 of the Guidelines requires an existing entity proposed to be
converted into SFB to be owned and controlled by residents, Para 7 of the
Guidelines allows foreign shareholding in SFB upto 74%. We request you to
clarify as to how an entity that is owned and controlled by residents can have
foreign shareholding upto 74%?
A. The requirement of owned and controlled by residents is applicable to the promoter
entity, whereas 74 per cent FDI/FII limit applies to the bank.
27107. As per the present FDI Policy, the limit on NRI investment of 10% / 24% is
applicable for investment under Portfolio Investment Schemes through stock
exchanges (schedule 2, regulation 5(2) and not for investment under Foreign
Direct Investment Scheme (Schedule I, regulation 5(1)). Accordingly, Para 7
(Foreign Shareholding) of Reserve Bank of India’s Guidelines for Licensing of
“Small Finance Banks” in the Private Sector vide Press Release dated November
27, 2014, on NRI investment of 10% / 24% is applicable for investment under
Portfolio Investment Scheme through stock exchanges only. As such under
Automatic route, NRIs and other eligible foreign investors in aggregate can invest
to the extent of 49%. We would request your good self to kindly clarify the same.
A. Extant FEMA guidelines will be applicable.
108. Would paid-up equity capital include only voting capital and not non-voting
equity shares/preference shares?
A. The minimum paid-up equity capital of Rs.100 crore shall include only voting capital.
109. Would 5% voting rights limit apply to promoter (as he may also be a
shareholder) or does it apply to shareholders other than promoter/s?
A. As per Section 12 (2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, any shareholder's voting
rights in private sector banks are capped at 10 per cent. Therefore, the voting rights cap
also applies to the promoters
110. In case of SFBs, does RBI envisage shares with differential voting rights? On
one hand, 5% voting rights can be increased to 26% in a phased manner whereas
there is a restriction of maximum of 10% holding which appears contradictory.
A. SFBs can issue differential voting rights, subject to minimum equity capital of Rs.100
crore being voting equity. As regards, second part there is no contradiction. As on date
the voting rights are limited to 10 per cent per shareholder (Section 12(2) of the Banking
28Regulation Act,1949). The provision relating to 26 per cent voting rights is an enabling
provision for the future.
111. What criteria would be considered by RBI for raising the voting rights to 26
per cent?
Act)?
As on date the voting rights are limited to 10 per cent per shareholder (as per BR
A. The provision relating to 26 per cent voting right is an enabling provision for the
future.
112. Where a Small Finance Bank is promoted by a company, would all transfers
of shares of the promoter company require prior permission from the
RBI? or prior permission will be required only for transfer of shares held by the
promoter/ group entities?
A. As per Section 12B of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, any acquisition of 5 per
cent or more of the paid-up share capital in a private sector bank will require prior
approval of RBI. As regards the promoter entity, all transfers which will result in
significant change in ownership and/or control will require prior approval of RBI.
113. Whether the shareholding in the intermediate holding company can change
inter-se between Promoter group within the thresholds?
A. In case the promoters desire to set up the small finance bank under the NOFHC, the
NOFHC would be required to be wholly owned by the promoter group and any change
in shareholding within the promoter group of 5 per cent or more in the NOFHC should
be with prior approval of RBI.
114. Will PSL criteria be applicable on the very first day of a new small bank or a
timeline for compliance would be provided for the same?
29115. In case of conversion of NBFC/MFI into bank, will the priority sector lending
targets apply only to new loans issued after commencement of banking
operations? Or will they also apply to existing portfolio? In such case, will they
get a time window to meet the priority sector targets?
A.(114 & 115) Priority sector obligations will take effect with reference to the adjusted
st
net bank credit (ANBC) (OBSE) as on 31
March following the commencement of
banking business. For example, if ‘in-principle’ approval is granted in June 2015, the
bank has to commence banking business latest by December 2016. In that case, the
bank has to maintain PSL by March 31, 2018 on the ANBC base as of March 31,
2017(the reference date). In such a scenario about 33 months would be available to the
Promoters/Promoter Group to achieve the PSL target on the existing loan book carried
over to the new bank.
116. Will CRR/SLR norms be applicable on the very first day of a new small bank
or a time line for compliance would be provided for the same?
117. When an existing MFI is to be converted to the bank, the SLR/CRR
requirements are to be met. If the MFI has a borrowing from banks of around Rs.
3000 crore on the date of conversion, it would be required to invest about Rs. 850
Crore in the Government Securities for SLR/CRR purpose on the first date of
conversion itself which would be a huge challenge. While SLR/CRR are a must
and must be complied with, by all banks, in the safety of depositors, we would
seek that some time be given to existing MFIs who are converting, to meet this
requirement. The time can be in the range of about 1-2 years to achieve SLR/CRR
on a graded basis on a quarterly basis.
A (116 to 117). No forbearance for maintenance of CRR and SLR will be granted by
RBI, as these are statutory requirement for the banks.
30118. PSL status of the Loans taken from Banks before conversion: On our books,
these are loans taken from bank for on lending. These loans enjoy the PSL
benefit on the books of the lender bank. Given that RBI has mentioned
grandfathering of charge on the books of the NBFC; will RBI also grandfather
these loans to enjoy the PSL status, post conversion of the NBFC into SFB, as
any withdrawal of PSL benefit may result in banks recalling / repricing the loan to
the NBFC/SFB?
A. Loans against the borrowings from other banks will cease to have PSL status for the
lending banks once the new SFB commences its business.
119. Kindly clarify the meaning / scope of ‘group obligor’.
A. Group obligor means group borrower and the group exposure would include loans,
advances, investments, etc.
120. Whether the word ‘exposure’ covers providing loans and advances or also
cover arm’s length business relations (selling of product acting as agents, BCs
etc)?
121. Is the word ‘exposure’ limited to providing loans and advances or does is
also cover arm’s length business relations (such as selling of product acting as
agents, BCs etc.)?
A. (120 & 121) The guidelines indicate that, the maximum loan size and investment limit
exposure to a single and group obligor would be restricted to 10 per cent and 15 per
cent of its capital funds, respectively. For a complete coverage of the word “exposure”,
please see RBI Master Circular RBI/2014-15/66 DBOD.No.Dir.BC.12/13.03.00/2014-15
dated July 01, 2014 on Exposure Norms.
122. Can a SFB choose to allocate 40% of the PSL requirement to sub‐ sector
suited to its comparative advantage or will it be required to lend to different
sub‐ sectors that qualify towards PSL?
31A. No. The guidelines clearly indicate that 40 per cent of the small finance bank’s
Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) should be allocated to different sub-sectors under
PSL as per the extant PSL prescriptions of RBI. The balance 35 per cent can be allotted
to any one or more sub-sectors where it has comparative advantages.
123. On the day 1 of the start of the SFB (after the 18 months transformation
period) will CRR & SLR apply on the earlier term loans taken from banks which
are allowed to be grandfathered? (capital charge)
A. Yes.
124. Will the new SFB be allowed to keep such grandfathered loans out of the
computation of Inter Bank limits till the maturity of the loans?
A. Necessary guidelines will be issued in due course.
125. When a NBFC (Non-Deposit taking) converts into a Small Finance Bank, will
it require maintaining CRR & SLR on its existing Borrowings which are secured
and institutional and not in the nature of demand deposits?
A. Yes.
126. Will there be any restriction on the rate of interest for deposits and
advances?
A. The small finance bank will be subject to all prudential norms and regulations of RBI
as applicable to existing commercial banks( para 9 of the guidelines).
127. Will RBI consider allowing the small finance bank to take over and convert
own existing NBFC branches into bank branches?
A. Please refer to para 10 of the guidelines
32128. In case of grand-fathering of loans, there is a reference made to additional
capital charge? Could you elaborate on the same?
129. Where floating charges are created by the NBFCs/ MFIs, the guideline says
that RBI will provide for ‘grandfathering’. Can you kindly explain the course of
action intended in this case and the time line to substitute this charge by
alternative sources? Can you also explain what kind of capital norms RBI is
thinking of in those cases to provide the grandfathering?.
A.(128 & 129) The norms with regard to additional capital charge will be decided in due
course.
130. Grandfathering of existing loans and interbank limits: Will the new SFB be
allowed to keep such grandfathered loans out of the computation of inter bank
limits till the maturity of the loans?
131. Most NBFCs rely on bank financing as a major source of funding. If an
NBFC converts into a Small Finance Bank (SFB), it will have to comply with the
current banking regulations which limit the net interbank borrowing for any bank
to three times its net worth. Most NBFCs will not be able to comply with this
regulation. This is because, currently, the average bank funding of NBFCs is not
less than 4 to 5 times their net worth. The average bank funding is much higher in
case of Housing Finance Companies. It will be difficult for the NBFCs to overnight
convert their bank funding through alternative sources such as deposits. There
may thus be a need to provide for grandfathering. The guidelines do outline
grandfathering of floating charges against bank borrowings until these
borrowings mature.
132. New Loans and Interbank Limits during the conversion period: Post
conversion of NBFC into SFB, the new SFB will need 12-18 months to build up the
deposit momentum. During this phase, will RBI permit the new SFB to continue to
33tap into bank borrowing under the previous NBFC criteria and not limit the
borrowing of SFB based on inter-bank limits?
A.(130 & 132) Necessary guidelines will be issued in due course.
133. The guidelines restrict the non-promoter’s holding to 10 per cent. In this
regard, kindly clarify whether the non-Promoter’s holding in the Intermediate
holding company (being owned and controlled by residents) promoting the
proposed SFB would also be counted for this purpose?
A. In case the promoters desire to set up the Small Finance Bank under the NOFHC,
the NOFHC would be required to be wholly owned by the promoter group and no non-
promoter shareholding would be allowed in the NOFHC.
134. The guidelines prescribe that NBFCs / MFIs can also opt for conversion into
SFBs. Please clarify whether an existing NBFC / MFI can set-up a SFB separately.
In such an event, kindly clarify whether all financial services business which
could be undertaken by SFB need to be folded into SFB?
A. An NBFC can set up a SFB. However, all lending activity should be folded into bank.
The guidelines indicate that on conversion into a small finance bank, the NBFC / MFI
will cease to exist and all its business which a bank can undertake should fold into the
bank and the activities which a bank cannot undertake be divested / disposed of. The
other financial and non-financial services activities of the promoters should be kept
distinctly ring-fenced and not comingled with the bank
135. Whether an existing NBFC in the Promoter group can co-exist with the SFB
where the business of the said NBFC is non-competing (i.e. the ticket size, target
customer, etc. are different) with the business to be conducted by the proposed
SFB?
34A. No. All permitted lending activity should be folded into the bank and the activities
which a bank cannot undertake be disposed of.
136. RBI may kindly clarify the dispensation available (on the lines of item ii Para
13) to the existing investors (mainly PE) in the existing NBFC-MFI regarding their
maximum stakes that would be permitted in case the NBFC-MFI converts itself in
a small finance bank.
A. Para 13(ii) applies to existing investors including PEs.
137. The guidelines provide that in case of existing NBFCs/ MFIs (opting to
convert into a SFB) which have diluted the promoters’ shareholding to below 40
per cent, but above 26 per cent, due to regulatory requirements or otherwise, RBI
may not insist on the Promoters’ minimum initial contribution of 40 percent. In
this regard, kindly clarify the meaning of the term ‘otherwise’ or under which
other scenarios, 26% Promoters’ shareholding (as against the 40%) would be
acceptable to RBI?
138. What is meant by ‘dilution by regulatory requirement or otherwise’ – if the
shares of a MFI are issued to a strategic investor which has resulted into dilution
of promoter’s stake be regarded as falling within this?
A.(137 & 138) “Otherwise” can be interpreted in a general sense to mean as any other
reason apart from regulatory requirements. The applicant should explain the
circumstances.
139. Where an existing NBFC/ MFI/ LAB proposes to convert into a SFB, can the
preference shares already issued be included in calculating the net worth of Rs
100 crore of the existing entity?
35A. Currently, preference shares of the nature indicated in Master Circular RBI/2014-
15/76
DBOD.No.BP.BC.4/21.01.002/2014-15 - Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy - Basel
I Framework dated July 1, 2014, only are eligible for inclusion in net worth.
140. Would any relief (or transition period exceeding 18 months) be available in
relation to the requirement of additional infusion of capital to an existing
NBFC/MFI/LAB, having a paid up share capital of Rs. 100 crores or more but
having losses because of which its net worth is less than Rs. 100 crore?
A. No.
141. For existing NBFC-MFIs and transformation cases, apparently the promoter
holding required is 26% and Foreign holding can be up to 74% as long as the
same has been done under FDI & RBI guidelines? This may please be confirmed.
A. The presumption that the promoter’s stake for all NBFCs is 26% is incorrect. The
promoter holding of 26% will be allowed where the reduction has taken place due to
regulatory requirement.
142. For existing NBFC‐ MFI transformation cases, existing plus additional paid‐ up
capital should add to INR 100 Crore: does this mean that any share premium
collected in this additional raise process will not be counted?
A. The share premium collected in raising additional paid-up capital will be counted for
the purpose of net worth.
143. At the time of application, are experienced directors required?
A. The names of the Board of Directors of the small finance bank would be required to
be furnished to the Reserve Bank after grant of in-principle approval.
36144. Whether the Director / Individual Shareholder of an entity promoting a SFB
could become the Chairman of such bank?
A. Yes, subject to prior approval of RBI as per section 35B of the Banking Regulation
Act, 1949.
145. Whether the Promoter entity and the SFB can have common directors?
146. Where the promoter of the SFB already has independent directors, it may be
clarified whether the said independent directors being nominated on the Board of
the SFB will also qualify as independent directors for the SFB.
147. Can the Promoter entity and the Bank have common directors including
managing director and common independent directors?
A.(145 to 147) There could be non-executive common directors in the promoter entity
and the small finance bank. However, a director of the promoter entity being also a
director on the Board of the bank will not be considered as independent director of the
bank.
148. The requirement of majority being independent directors. Does such
requirement exist for any kind of bank/financial institution already or is it only
proposed for Small Finance Bank?
A. The requirement of independent Directors are already applicable to existing listed
banks as per the Clause 49 requirements of SEBI.
149. Would a small finance ank be directly participating in clearing or it would
need to go through some large bank?
37A. The bank can decide upon the type of membership– direct or through sub-member
route, depending upon the access criteria (eligibility norms) set for respective payment
system.
150. A company may have > 10% non-promoter individual shareholding at the
time of in-principle approval. Will the 3 year period of reduction to <= 10%, start
from date of in-principle approval of license or commencement of banking
