5. Whether customer/depositor can claim a refund of their unclaimed amounts from the DEA Fund?
Yes, customer/depositor can claim a refund of their unclaimed amounts from their banks. Based on the request of claim made by customer/depositor or legal heirs (in case of deceased depositors), the banks shall repay the customer/depositor along with interest (applicable only in case of Interest-Bearing deposit accounts) and then lodge a claim for a refund from the DEA Fund maintained by the RBI for an equivalent amount paid to the customer/depositor.
6. Is there a time limit for the customer/ depositor for claiming the amount from the DEA Fund?
There is no specific time limit prescribed in the Scheme for claiming a refund from the DEA Fund by the customer/ depositor. However, customer/ depositor or the legal heirs (in case of deceased depositor) are encouraged to claim such amounts as soon as they become aware of unclaimed amounts.
7. What is the procedure to claim from DEA Fund, if a bank is under liquidation?
In the case of a bank under liquidation, the depositor has to approach the Liquidator of the bank for claim and the Liquidator would settle the claim as per the following procedure
Scenario 1: Claim on deposits covered by DICGC - If the deposits of a customer/depositor were covered by DICGC insurance at the time of transfer to the DEA Fund, then the Liquidator can claim an amount equivalent to what could have been claimed from DICGC (i.e., currently up to ₹5 lakh including accrued interest, if applicable, in same right and capacity1), and then make payment to the depositor. If the above deposit amount is more than the insurance cover of DICGC, then the Liquidator shall claim the amount in excess of DICGC insurance cover (i.e., over and above the ₹5 lakh) only on reimbursement basis. (i.e., the Liquidator will pay such amount to the depositor subject to meeting all the applicable requirements and thereafter submit a claim to DEA Fund for reimbursement)
Illustration 1: A customer/depositor had a deposit claim of ₹4 lakh in a bank (including accrued interest), which is now under liquidation. The deposit was insured by DICGC at the time when the said unclaimed deposit was transferred to the DEA Fund. Now, if he/she claims the same during the liquidation process, the following steps shall be followed:
The customer/depositor/ legal heir submits a claim for his/her deposit to the Liquidator.
Liquidator raises an equivalent claim of ₹4 lakh from DEA Fund along with necessary supporting documents.
DEA Fund will pay an amount equal to the insured deposit to the Liquidator. (In this case, i.e., ₹4 lakh, since DICGC insurance cover is available up to ₹5 lakh).
The Liquidator, after receiving the amount from the DEA Fund, will pay to the customer/depositor i.e., ₹4 lakh.
Illustration 2: A customer/depositor had a deposit claim of ₹6 lakh in a bank (including accrued interest), which is now under liquidation. The deposit was insured by DICGC at the time when the unclaimed deposit of his/her was transferred to the DEA Fund. Now, if he/she claims the same during the liquidation process, the following steps shall be followed:
The customer/depositor/legal heir submits a claim for his/her deposit to the Liquidator.
Liquidator raises an equivalent claim of ₹6 lakh from DEA Fund, along with necessary supporting documents.
DEA Fund will pay only an amount equal to the insured deposit to the Liquidator. (In this case, i.e., ₹5 lakh, since DICGC insurance cover is available up to ₹5 lakh).
For the remaining amount (i.e., ₹1 lakh) the Liquidator shall make the payment to depositor subject to meeting all the applicable requirements and then claim for the same from DEA Fund by way of reimbursement.
Scenario 2: Claim on deposits not covered by DICGC: In respect of deposits not covered by DICGC2 at the time of transfer to DEA Fund, the payment to the Liquidator by DEA Fund shall be made only on reimbursement basis (i.e., the Liquidator can only seek as a reimbursement after settling the amount to the customer/ depositor) as mentioned in Illustration 2(iv) above.
